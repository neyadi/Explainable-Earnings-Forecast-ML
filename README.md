# Machine Learning for Explainable Future Earnings Forecasting

This repository contains the implementation of my MSc thesis project, titled "Machine Learning for Explainable Future Earnings Forecasting", at Khalifa University of Science and Technology. The project explores the application of machine learning techniques, particularly Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), to forecast the direction of future quarterly earnings and provides interpretations using Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, including SHAP and LIME.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this study consists of financial statement and earnings data sourced from Compustat and the Institutional Brokers' Estimate System (IBES). It covers a wide range of public companies over a period between 1985-2020.

## Installation

Instructions for setting up the project environment:

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/neyadi/Explainable-Earnings-Forecast-ML.git

# navigate to the project directory
cd Explainable-Earnings-Forecast-ML
```

## Usage

To use this project and get the results in the thesis, you need to follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Jupyter installed. If not, you can install it using pip:
```bash
pip install notebook
```

2. Navigate to the project directory, if you haven't already:
```bash
cd Explainable-Earnings-Forecast-ML
```

3. Start Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

4. Once Jupyter Notebook is running, it should open in your web browser. Navigate through the `code` directory.
   
5. Inside the `code` directory, you will find a series of Jupyter notebooks (`*.ipynb` files). These notebooks are prefixed with numbers indicating the order in which they should be executed.

Note: Some notebooks may depend on the outputs of the previous ones. Ensure all notebooks are run in the sequence provided to maintain consistency in results.
